# Vite, React and Typescript project using Statkart + Deck.gl
## Introduction
This is a web application built during a GIS workshop using Vite, React, Typescript and Deck.gl. The application is a map that displays markers on a map provided by the Norwegian Statkart using their APIs and visualizes the data using Deck.gl and is written in TypeScript for static type checking and improved developer experience.
